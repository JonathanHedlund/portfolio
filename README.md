# My portfolio!

This is the code for my portfolio that is up and running at [http://jonathanhedlund.com]. Check it out if you're interested in seeing 
how I made the things that are displayed.

## How to run the application

To load all the dependencies open up your command line and navigate to the root of the
project and execute using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Replace .env variable

This step is not really necessary, but if you want to view the map from Google you need to replace the following .env variable.

```
APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

### Start the server

Once the previous steps are completed you can start the server using one 
of the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```


## Thats it!

Thanks for checking it out! All the code in this application was written by me (Jonathan Hedlund).
