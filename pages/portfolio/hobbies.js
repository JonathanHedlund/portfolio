                        the same year when I wanted to come up with and develop an idea alongside my studies.
                        The idea came from a wish to take my interests to the next level and get more out of
                        excercising them on my own and find others (preferrably in person) who share my interest that 
                        I could connect to. Instead of continuing to develop the idea further I started working at
                        Uminova Innovation and Splick. So the idea stayed dormant until this course started up.'/>

                        a project that you could feel more attached to. During the course we got to do a lot
                        of things related to the start-up process that are "less fun", but incredibly healthy 
                        to get more experience at since it is crucial to increasing the success rate to take into 
                        consideration and evaluate further. The start-up process is one that intrerest me greatly, 
                        and it is because of that interest I have decided to search for opportunities in those areas.
                        Splick and Uminova Innovation are two great examples of that. That ends the Hobbies chapter in
